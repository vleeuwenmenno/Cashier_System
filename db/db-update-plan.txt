We need to make a cron.php file that will check all contracts. Then we can add this as a cronjob to `crontab -e` so we can do this check every 5 minutes.
When checking contracts we need to calculate if we need to send any order emails out at that time.
Here we need to make sure we haven't send an email on that day for the same contract yet.
If it appears that we need to send out an email, we will make a new log entry with it's details.
